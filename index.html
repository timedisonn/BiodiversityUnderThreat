                        The volatile balance of the Australian nature, which prior to the colonisation by Europeans
                        in the late 1700s was largely left intact and free from outside influence. This environment
                        is susceptible towards the smallest of changes in nature. The Australian government, through
                        relevant legislation such as the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC),
                        has listed over 100 extinct species, 10 of which were added within the last 2 years alone,
                        and the number of threatened animal species is continuing to rise.</p>

                                    <p>Koalas are one of the worlds most notable marsupials that can only be found in
                                        Australia. They are often thought to be bears, but they are actually not. Their
                                        diet primarily consists of eucalyptus tree leaves, and as such, they dwell on
                                        these trees most of the time. They are known to be sedentary, and they spend
                                        most of their time sleeping, moving only when it is necessary. Koalas are under
                                        the threat of extinction, due to habitat loss and climate change. Deforestation
                                        has affected their limited spread, and when combined with a lot of different
                                        climactic factors, their survival in the coming decades are under the watchful

            <p>Threats to the Australian biodiversity comes in many different kinds, but according to a recent report,
                the top 3 threats to the Australian biodiversity are Invasive Species, Ecosystem Modifications, and

                    As shown in the chart, The Rabbit is responsible for threatening around more than 300 native
                    Australian

                <h2>Rabbits?</h2>
                <p>Rabbits were introduced to Australia in the middle of the 19th century for hunting, but not long
                    after they went loose their population exploded, as they have no natural predators, and the
                    Australian environment suits their breeding patterns as a whole. Rabbits are invasive in many
                    different ways, for instance, they overgraze lands, which leads to lack of food supply in the area,
                    and soil erosion that changes the whole landscape. Take Phillip Island as an example, Phillip island
                    was once a home to a large rabbit population, but once they were eradicated, we can see that the
                    island is in a much better shape than it was before. These are some of the harsh realities that the
                    native Australian fauna is facing. There have been previous attempts of population control, but in
                    reality as shown through the graph (Cooke et al, 2013), the rabbit population will always recover.
                    It's a race against time, and we only have finite resources.</p>

                recent disasters in Australian History. the 2019-2020 Bushfires were one of the worst ecological
                disaster events in Australia's history. The fires burned an estimated $5 billion dollars, around
                8% of Australia's agricultural GDP. But not only that, a lot of different species were effected.
                Take the koalas for example. after the fires, The Australian government listed Koalas as being
                Endangered. Koalas primarily live on the East coast of Australia. As shown in the chart, the fires
                burned a lot of its habitat, resulting in its population decline.

            <h1>Humans. It's Humans.</h1>
            <p>Since the colonisation of Australia, Humans are responsible for all of these changes.
                We have introduced invasive species, we have changed the landscape, and we have deforested
                the land. We are the ones responsible for the current state of the Australian environment,
                and for that reason, we should do our best to change the course!

            <h2>We're still destroying nature!</h2>
            <p>Take for example, as of now, the Australian government has committed to net zero emissions by 2050.
                However, we're still far from targets. According to the statistics, We are only going to reach about
                85% of net 0 targets, which is still insufficient, and adding salt to the wound, we are still having
                new coal, gas, and other non renewable resources projects ongoing, and as shown in the chart, Coal
                project marks a significant amount of new projects</p>

                <h2>So how can you help?</h2>
                <p>The future seems bleak. That is undeniable. But when more and more people bind together not as
                    individuals, but as a team, changes are possible. We can donate to charitable sources, like the
                    Australian World Wildlife Fund, or we can volunteer to help conserve local flora and fauna. We can
                    also contact our local representatives, to make sure that they are aware of our concerns, and so
                    that they could call for actions that represent our values better.</p>
